# Kanji For You:

## Description

_Duration: 2 Weeks_

Over the course of two weeks, the goal was to create a functional full-stack web based application. The web based application allow users to keep track of the Japanese kanji they are learning, while also serving as a study tool through the use of a dictionary and flashcards.

## Description & Approach

By creating a scope document for the project, I was able to envision how I wanted the website to operate and flow. By using wireframes and describing what each page does, I was able to create a comfortable user flow.
